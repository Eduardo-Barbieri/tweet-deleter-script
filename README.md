# tweet-deleter-script
Scripts build to erase all tweets from a personal account, designed for weak setups.

Two versions in this repository, the first in pure python, the second in jupyter notebook.

The notebook version was made to fix a reocurring error, as describe in both files, it may not be necessary for your personal use, but I found the fix interesting enough to share.

Enjoy
